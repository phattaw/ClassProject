This is a sports review page.It was motivated by a simple fact that people love sports, they love to follow their favorite team, league,or player. It was my groups first class project. It was styled with Bulma and a custom CSS, it uses three api's, ghiphy, news api and seat geek. We made several social media accounts including Facebook,Twitter,Instagram and Youtube. The news api keeps all the sports news up to date and seat geek allows you to find the team in the city you're in and find tickets for said game. We also made a contact page to communicate with us with a active email account. Also we created a login page. You can use your gmail account to login and get updates on various sports.
